## packages used
### styled components:
allows easy co-location of styles in the same page as JSX, so it’s easy to find everything related to the component

### date-fns:
lightweight library for easy manipulation and calculation of dates. used granular imports to ensure that bundle size is affected minimally

### react-calendar: 
accessible calendar component implementation. used it to leapfrog the granular details of calendar implementation, as this is a problem that’s been properly solved already.
